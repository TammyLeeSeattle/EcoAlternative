This app allows the user to choose a category they would like to learn more about.  The top of the page contains education regarding the importance of choosing eco-friendly products and why current products may be wasteful, while the rest of the page contains links to purchase eco-friendly options.  With an app like this, we hope to spread awareness about the importance of the environment and choosing more eco-friendly options for your everyday products.
