 (1,'Moisturizer',1,'Many common moisturizes are purchased in a plastic container which cannot be absorbed back into the environment.  Many moisturizers contain dimethicone, which is toxic to the environment because it is a non-biodegradable chemical.')
,(2,'Facial Oil',1,'Many skincare products contain ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, BHA and tricolsan.  When rinsed down the drain, these end up in our water supply and can have a negative impact both on our bodies and on the marine/wildlife.')
,(3,'Shampoo',1,'Most common brand shampoos are purchased in a plastic container which cannot be absorbed back into the environment.  Most shampoos contain sodium laureth sulfate, which has been shown to be mutagenic to animals and can have a major impact when washed down our drains.')
,(4,'Sheets',2,'72% of bed linens end up in landfills which contributes to 10 million tons of textile waste per year in the U.S.')
,(5,'Mattress',2,'Americans get rid of 15-20 million mattresses per year.  These mattresses take up 132,000 miles of landfill space because they do not compact well at the landfill.')
,(6,'Comforter',2,'Many comforters are filled with petroleum-based polyester or feathers sterilized with formaldehyde.  These chemicals prevent the comforter from breaking down for years once it reaches a landfill.')
,(7,'Toilet Paper',3,'Toilet paper requires forests to be cut down and water is wasted to clean the pulp.  Chemicals are also involved when toilet paper is manufactured which pollutes local water sources.')
,(8,'Towels',3,'Dyeing and treatment of textiles is responsible for 17% of industrial water pollution.  Cottons uses 3% of global water and only 1% of cotton towels are currently organic.')
,(9,'Shower Head',3,'Shower heads are very wasteful and can use 5+ gallons of water per minute!  There is also a significant amount of energy utilized to heat the water in the shower.')
,(10,'Toothbrush',3,'50 million pounds of toothbrushes are added to landfills in the U.S. annually!  Manual toothbrushes are made from polypropylene plastic and nylon which are non-renewable fossil fuels.')
,(11,'Floss',3,'Most floss comes in a plastic packaging that is too small to be processed at a recycling plant.  Floss is also not reusable because it can reintroduce bacteria and plaque.')
,(12,'Razor',3,'The EPA estimates that 2 billion razors are thrown away each year. That’s outrageous, considering that you can’t recycle disposable razors in the U.S. You can recycle the steel blades (check with your local recycling center first), but your standard disposable razor is going to the landfill.')
,(13,'Loofah',3,'Eco friendly sponges loofahs are important because they are made from materials found in nature, not from man-made materials produced in factories that emit pollution and waste. While no sponge is perfect from a green perspective — environmentalists do have concerns regarding the harvesting and processing of natural materials to be used as bath accoutrements — they generally emit less pollution and create less waste in their creation than their artificial counterparts.')
,(14,'Toothpaste',3,'Some chemicals in the toothpaste are problematic -Those chemicals are spitted down the drain, leaking into river, lakes and ocean downstream, causing a serious water pollution, as people spend 3,000 hours brushing their teeth in their lifetime. In addition, most tubes/containers that toothpaste come in are non-recyclable')
,(15,'Cotton Balls',3,'Cotton is very pesticide and water intensive and many cotton swabs are non-recyclable. It is important to have an eco-friendly alternative.')
,(17,'Cleaning Solution',4,'Toxic chemicals are rinsed down the drains and, while some contaminants are removed, end up in our rivers and lakes.  Many throw away bottles when they''re empty and, since plastic is not biodegradable, it ends up in landfills indefinitely.')

,(24,'Heating & Cooling',6,'Heat pumps and air conditions use some form of refrigerant which is 1,900x worse for the environment than equal amounts of carbon dioxide!  Older appliances also tend to be much less energy efficient than newer ones, so they may be worth replacing.')
,(25,'Emergency supplies',6,'Batteries undergo a photochemical reaction as they decompose in landfills which causes emission of greenhouse gases!  Many common products like flashlights contain plastics which are not biodegradable and sit indefinitely in landfills.')

,(27,'Paper Towels',7,'Production of paper towels consumes 110 million trees per year and 130 billion gallons of water!  The manufacturing process also requires huge amounts of energy, causing carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere.  3,000 tons of paper towels end up in landfills annually and generates methane as it decomposes.')
,(28,'Ziploc Bags',7,'Many plastic bags cannot be recycled and end up in landfills for hundreds of years.  Many plastic bags are littered and cause death of animals like birds that consume them.')
,(29,'Reusable Bags',7,'Canvas shopping bags would need to be used 100 times in a row to make them become environmentally safe.  Paper bags require the use of trees, water and electricity in significant amounts making them a poor choice for the environment as well.')

,(34,'Shampoo',9,'Most common brand shampoos are purchased in a plastic container which cannot be absorbed back into the environment.  Most shampoos contain sodium laureth sulfate, which has been shown to be mutagenic to animals and can have a major impact when washed down our drains.')

,(38,'Hygiene',10,'When washing synthetic garments, plastic fibers make their way from the washing machine to waterways.  These microfibers that are relased can negatively impact plants and animals.')
,(39,'Utensils',10,'Plastic utensils are rarely recycled, meaning they end up contaminating our waterways.  They are also widely littered, meaning wild animals may feed on these, cuasing injuries or killing these animals.')
,(40,'Fitness',10,'Many yoga mats are produced using PVC, which is a cheap plastic that cannot be recycled due to toxins embedded within it.  When they reach landfills or are burned, they release dioxin which is a known carcinogen.')
,(41,'Solar',11,'Using solar panels/energy is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint - it doesn''t pollute, doesn''t release any greenhouse gases and doesn''t use any other resources.  Traditional electricity uses fossil fuels like coal and natural gas which are both bad for the environment and are limited resources.')
,(42,'Home',11,'Appliances left on standby contribute to 8% of the total electricity used in homes.  Keeping appliances plugged into the wall still continues to use energy, even if not in use.  Meanwhile, many thermostats are inefficient and made from plastic which is not biodegradable and lives in landfills for many years.');
